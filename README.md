# How-To use CUDA and PyTorch on WSL2

## Introduction

Welcome to this simple guide designed to help you navigate the integration and utilization of __CUDA with PyTorch in a WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) environment__. This project aims to bridge the gap between Windows-based development and the powerful capabilities of Linux-driven, GPU-accelerated deep learning.

This guide has been tested on Windows 11 but should also work on Windows 10.

**This guide is work in progress `:fire:`**
